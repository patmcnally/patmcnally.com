h1. This is the data for my blog

It is automatically transformed by
"Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll into a static site whenever
I push this repository to GitHub.

This has been heavily inspired by Tom Preston-Werner's own blog which
can be seen on his "github":http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master
