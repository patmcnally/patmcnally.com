I've been seeing phrases like "I make things" or "I build stuff"
attached to many developers, makers, or hackers's profiles. It's
almost become cliche which is why I've buried it deep in this
copy. But I find it rings true. It resonates with anyone who has
stared at an empty git-repo, or generated a fresh rails app. It's the
thrill of possibilities and the joy of creation.

I'm proud to be a member of the after-work hackers, the
dad's with side-projects, the compulsive experimenters,
the late night coders club. And this is place where I try to
make some record of it all.
