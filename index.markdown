I've been seeing phrases like, "I make things," or, "I build stuff,"
attached to many developers', makers', or hackers' profiles.  Phrases
like these have almost become clich√©, which is why I've buried them
deep in this copy. But I find they ring true. They resonate with
anyone who has stared at an empty git-repo, or generated a fresh rails
app. They capture the thrill of possibilities and the joy of creation.

I'm proud to be a member of the after-work hackers, the dads with
side-projects, the compulsive experimenters, the late-night coders'
club. And this is the place where I try to make some record of it all.
